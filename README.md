## Modelling ice coverage in Antarctica

The project was based on historical data (1978-2009) from the Copernicus Climate Research Store.
The data was processed to then create a gif based on the data showing the variability of the ice extent through:
* minimum extent
* actual extent
* mathematical model of ice extent as a function of time
